1. Understand the Data:
Load the dataset and inspect the first few rows (head()).
Check the shape of the dataset (shape).
Review column names and data types (info()).

2. Handle Missing Values:
Identify missing values (isnull().sum()).
Decide on strategies to handle missing data (e.g., drop rows/columns, fill with mean/median/mode).

3. Summary Statistics:
Generate descriptive statistics (describe()).
Check for outliers using statistical measures (e.g., IQR, z-scores).

4. Data Distribution:
Visualize the distribution of numerical features (e.g., histograms, boxplots).
Analyze categorical feature distributions (e.g., bar plots).

5. Relationships Between Variables:
Use scatter plots, pair plots, or correlation heatmaps to identify relationships between numerical variables.
Analyze relationships between categorical and numerical variables (e.g., boxplots, groupby mean).

6. Data Cleaning:
Standardize column names (e.g., lowercase, remove spaces).
Remove duplicates (drop_duplicates()).
Handle inconsistent data entries (e.g., typos, inconsistent formats).

7. Feature Engineering:
Create new features if necessary (e.g., combining columns, extracting date parts).
Encode categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding).

8. Outlier Detection:
Identify and handle outliers using visualizations (e.g., boxplots) or statistical methods.

9. Time Series Analysis (if applicable):
Check for trends, seasonality, and patterns in time-based data.

10. Visualization:
Use libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly for visual exploration.
Create meaningful plots to summarize findings.

11. Insights and Observations:
Document key insights and patterns observed during the analysis.
